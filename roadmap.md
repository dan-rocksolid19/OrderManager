# Runtime Log Review – 2025-07-31 17:47

### Boot sequence status
1. Database checks, migrations, and auth bootstrap all executed without errors.
2. All Peewee/SDBC connections opened and closed cleanly.
3. Application components (FrameManager, Sidebar, ComponentManager, Login page) initialised and resized successfully.
4. BootManager reported "Application boot completed successfully" and overall init time was 0.42 s.

### Non-fatal warnings observed
| Timestamp | Source | Message |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| 17:47:12 | jobmanager.command_ctr.main | Source icon not found: `pybrex/graphics/sidebar/open-sidebar.png` |
| 17:47:12 | jobmanager.command_ctr.main | Source icon not found: `pybrex/graphics/sidebar/close-sidebar.png` |
| 17:47:12 | component_manager | Source icon not found: `pybrex/graphics/copy_arrow_right.png` |

These warnings indicate that the referenced PNG assets are missing from the packaged extension. Functionality continues but UI buttons will lack their icons.

### Next steps
1. Add the missing graphics files to `source/pybrex/graphics/sidebar/` and `source/pybrex/graphics/` OR update code to reference existing images.
2. Verify icon cache populates once assets are present (expect count > 0 in ComponentManager log).
3. No further errors—application now starts cleanly.
